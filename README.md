# Cpp-Programming-1
This repository encompasses diverse programs addressing specific programming challenges. The project includes internal documentation to aid in understanding and utilizing the functionalities of each program. Each program is outlined below:

1. **Base Converter**
    - Converts a number expressed in decimal base to other numeric bases specified by the user.

2. **Student Class Implementation**
    - Implements objects that take input data for student members of a class, assigns and stores them in a native vector, and then displays the information.

3. **Number Extraction from String**
    - Extracts numbers present in a string entered by the user and prints them if any are found.

4. **Pascal's Triangle Generator**
    - Takes the required number of levels for Pascal's Triangle as input and returns a vector representing the triangle. Each element of the returned vector corresponds to a level of Pascal's Triangle.

5. **Semiprime Numbers Finder**
    - Given a range of numbers, returns the semiprime numbers within that range.

6. **Diagonal Values Extractor**
    - A function that takes a square matrix as input and returns a vector containing the values of the diagonal.

7. **Dynamic Lists for Long Number Addition**
    - Utilizes dynamic lists to perform addition of long numbers, where each element of the list stores a value of the resulting number.
