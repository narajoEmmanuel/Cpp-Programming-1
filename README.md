# Cpp-Programming-1
This repository encompasses diverse programs addressing specific programming challenges. Each program is outlined below:

## 1. base10_to_other_bases
This program features a function, base10_to_other_bases, designed to convert a decimal number to various numeric bases. The function extracts a specific digit range from the input number and converts it to the desired base using the method of successive divisions.

## 2. Student Class Program
This program involves the implementation of a class, Student, as a user-defined data type. The steps include defining the interface in Estudiante.h, implementing it in Estudiante.cpp, and using the class functionalities in the main function.

## 3. numbers
The program includes a function, extract_numbers, that extracts numbers from a string and stores them in a forward list. Another function, print_extracted_numbers, prints the extracted numbers.

## 4. pascal_triangle
This program generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of levels using a function, pascal_triangle. Another function, print_pascal_triangle, prints the triangle based on the provided example.

## 5. semiprimes
The program includes a function, semiprimes, that identifies semiprimes within a specified interval. Another function, print_semiprimes, prints the semiprimes and their prime components.

## 6. extract_diagonal
This program features a function, extract_diagonal, that extracts values from a specified diagonal in a square matrix. Another function, print_diagonal_values, prints the extracted values.

## 7. large_numbers_sum
The program includes a function, sum_large_numbers, that adds two natural numbers represented as lists. Two auxiliary functions, convert_to_list and print_list, assist in number conversion and result printing.
